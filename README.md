# Hi there! 👋 I'm Mark

**Omics • AI • Coffee**

PhD in Molecular Biology from San Francisco who codes for fun. I build tools for genomics data, experiment with AI applications in biology, and analyze my coffee roasting curves (because why not apply data science to everything?).

## 🛠️ Current toolkit
Python • R • AWS • Docker • Nextflow • LangChain

## ☕ Fun fact
I collect data on my coffee roasts and build models to optimize flavor profiles. Data science meets caffeine addiction.
